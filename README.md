# Pima-Indians-Diabetes

Problem Statement: The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details. It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:

    Number of times pregnant.
    Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
    Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
    Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
    2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
    Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
    Diabetes pedigree function.
    Age (years).
    Is Diabetic (0 or 1).

**The main advantages:**
- out of the box feature of appropriate bias-variance trade-off,
- great computation speed as it utilises parallel computing and cache optimization,
- uses hardware optimization,
- works well even if the features are correlated
- robust even if there is noise for classification problem
- the facility of early stopping
- the package is evolving, i.e., new features are being added.
